# Fixtures

Some fixtures are used in tests and have been captured from actual webhook
calls. Others are copy/pasted from the BB Webhook API docs and used to generate
the matching go struct types. Some of the samples from the docs use placeholder
values to reference common shared sub-types and are not actually valid.
